### Hi there!

I'm a 25-year-old student from Switzerland with a strong passion for cybersecurity. My primary focus is developing **Golang** tools for **Red Teaming** and **penetration testing**.

Here are some of my key projects:

- [**KittyStager**](https://github.com/Enelg52/KittyStager) – A lightweight stage 0 command & control (C2) tool designed for stealth and simplicity.
- [**Offensive Golang**](https://github.com/Enelg52/OffensiveGo) – A collection of offensive security tools and utilities in Golang, ideal for Red Team engagements.
- [**Reconr**](https://github.com/syret-de/reconr) – An automation tool for pentesting tasks, developed as part of my diploma work.

Feel free to explore these projects and reach out if you're interested in collaboration or learning more about my work!
